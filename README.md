## HI!

# The purpose of this repository is to document my first real hands on BI Project.
The business case is the following: Small business client with e-commerce business. Currently there's managment troubles, since there's no control of the business data. Thus, I intent to: 
  1. Understand the data flow in the process
  2. Transform and aggregate the data in order to extract value
  3. Build relational model
  4. Design data pipeline
  5. Create BI dashboard that allows the user to see all of the information, and allows informed decisions
